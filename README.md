## PERFORMANCE RESULTS

### Latest Test Results (July 2025)

### Recent Test Status

**Note**: Recent performance tests (July 2025) are currently showing authentication issues (100% 401 errors). This indicates the need to:
- Configure proper authentication for performance testing
- Set up test API keys or disable auth for performance benchmarks
- Verify backend service connectivity

**Current Test Results (July 2025)**:
- **Throughput**: ~360 RPS (limited by auth errors)
- **Error Rate**: 100% (401 Unauthorized)
- **Latency**: 21-23ms average (affected by auth failures)
- **Memory Usage**: 2-3MB (efficient)
- **Status**: Requires authentication configuration fix
